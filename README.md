# Android News app x3

This is the same app implemented three times in three different technologies as an experiment:

- Pure Android*
- Xamarin
- React Native

*) Pure Android = What Google gives you out of the box.

I wanted to test the hypothesis that there are so many good native cross-platform technologies now that there is no excuse to write apps for Android only. 
What better way to test for an Android developer than to dive into two unknown technologies: Xamarin and React Native, and see what the experience is.

This repo is the result of that work.
